Mastermind is a code-breaking game for two players.

Game Description: (credit: wikipedia)
For the original physical version, The game is played using:

- a decoding board, with a shield at one end covering a row of four large holes, and ten additional rows containing four large holes next to a set of four small holes;
- code pegs of six different colors, with round heads, which will be placed in the large holes on the board; and
- key pegs, which are flat-headed and smaller than the code pegs; they will be placed in the small holes on the board.

The codebreaker tries to guess the pattern, in both order and color, within eight to twelve turns.
Each guess is made by placing a row of code pegs on the decoding board.
Once placed, the codemaker provides feedback by placing from zero to four key pegs in the small holes of the row with the guess.
A colored key peg is placed for each code peg from the guess which is correct in both color and position.
A white key peg indicates a code peg that belongs in the solution, but is incorrectly positioned.

Program Description:
1. The game is implemented to play only by 1 player.
2. Codemaker(CPU) randomly generate a 4-digit code in 6 colours.
3. Codebreaker(user) has 10 chances to decode the clue.
4. After each turn, the program will indicate the number of correct colour in correct position and correct colour in incorrect position.
5. Player win if player can decode in 10 turns.

Learning progress:
1. Practice on using while and for loop also with if statement in complex situation.
2. Using list and dictionary to store different player variables. e.g. list to store colour and dictionary to help checking correct and incorrect condition.
3. Use user defined function def to clean up the code.
